# skypebot
Welcome!

This is my R&D project to learn how Skype bots work.

This bot implementation can schedule notification tasks and notify you via Skype chat (one time or periodically) about custom events.

Bot implemented as web-servlet. Testet on Tomcat. Note: Skype bot backend servers require to support https connections and valid ssl certificate for your domain.

Please feel free to use my code for any goals.
